# RunoutAnywhere

**A Universal WiFi Filament Runout Sensor for OctoPrint**

---

## Overview

**RunoutAnywhere** is an ESP8266-based WiFi filament runout sensor designed to work seamlessly with [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) via its REST API.  
Inspired by the need for remote and reliable filament monitoring, this project allows you to place the sensor anywhereâ€”on your printer, enclosure, or even in your filament drybox.

- Uses a simple endstop or microswitch as the runout sensor.
- Sends pause/resume commands to OctoPrint over WiFi when filament runs out or is reloaded.
- No need to wire the sensor directly to the printer controller.

---

## Features

- **Wireless:** Place the runout sensor anywhere, no need for physical connection to the printer board.
- **OctoPrint Integration:** Communicates with OctoPrint using HTTP REST API.
- **LED Status:** Visual feedback for filament present, runout, communication status, and errors.
- **Optional Auto-Resume:** Optionally resumes printing automatically when filament is reloaded.
- **Simple Hardware:** Just an ESP8266 and a switch.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)
- Filament runout switch (normally closed or normally open)
- Status LED (optional, for visual feedback)
- 3D printer running OctoPrint (any board supported by OctoPrint)

## Wiring

| ESP8266 Pin | Function          | Description                  |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| GPIO2       | LED_PIN           | Status LED (optional)        |
| GPIO4       | SENSOR_PIN        | Filament runout switch input |

- Connect one side of the switch to `GND`, the other to `GPIO4`.
- LED (with resistor) from `GPIO2` to `GND`.

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Edit the Code:**
   - Set your WiFi SSID and password.
   - Set your OctoPrint server address and API key.
   - Choose `AUTO_RESUME` as desired.

2. **Flash the ESP8266:**
   - Use PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, or ESPTool.

3. **Configure OctoPrint:**
   - No plugins required, but ensure API access is enabled and the correct API key is set.

4. **Wiring:**
   - Connect switch and LED as described above.

5. **Test:**
   - Start a print, remove filament to trigger pause, reinsert and resume.

## LED Status Indicators

| Status                  | LED Behavior                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Filament present        | Solid ON                      |
| Runout (printing)       | Rapid flashing                |
| No filament (idle)      | Off, short blink              |
| Filament loaded, ready  | On, short blink               |
| Comms error             | Slow even blinking            |

---

## Example Configuration

Edit these lines in the code for your setup:
```cpp
const char* SSID = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
const char* OCTOPRINT_API_KEY = "YOUR_OCTOPRINT_API_KEY";
const char* OCTOPRINT_BASE_URL = "http://octoprint.local:5000/";
#define AUTO_RESUME false // or true, as desired
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If OctoPrint doesn't pause, check your ESP8266's WiFi and API key.
- Use the serial monitor for debug output.
- Make sure your firewall allows OctoPrint API access from the ESP8266.
