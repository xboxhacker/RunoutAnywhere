# RunoutAnywhere Klipper Edition (ESP8266/ESP32)

**WiFi Filament Runout Sensor for Klipper/Moonraker**

WiFi filament runout sensor for Klipper/Moonraker, now with support for sending the `M600` G-code command on filament runout. The M600 command allows you to use Klipper's macro handling for filament change events, giving you full control of the printer's behavior after runout.

---

## Features

- **Web GUI for configuration**  
  - Set Moonraker API URL and API Key
  - Save and reboot device from browser

- **LED Status Codes**  
  - Visual feedback for filament presence, runout, comms error, etc.

- **Persistent Settings**  
  - Stores API info in EEPROM

- **Klipper/Moonraker Integration**  
  - Sends `M600` to Klipper via HTTP when runout detected
  - Sends resume command on filament reload (optional)

- **Live Device Status**  
  - Web GUI shows WiFi, API, filament, and device state

- **Simple Endstop Support**  
  - Use any NO/NC switch for filament runout sensor

- **Easy ESP32 Adaptation**  
  - Minor code changes for ESP32 compatibility (see source comments)

## How It Works

1. **Startup & Configuration**
   - Device connects to configured WiFi.
   - Settings (Moonraker API URL, API key) are loaded from EEPROM.
   - A minimal web server is started on port 80 for configuration and status.

2. **Filament Sensor Monitoring**
   - The sensor pin is checked every 50ms.
   - When filament is present, LED is solid ON.
   - When filament is absent (runout), LED blinks rapidly.

3. **On Filament Runout**
   - Device detects a change from present to runout.
   - LED blinks rapidly as a visual alert.
   - Device sends an HTTP POST to the Moonraker API endpoint:
     ```
     POST /printer/gcode/script
     Content-Type: application/json
     X-Api-Key: {your_api_key}
     Body: {"script":"M600"}
     ```
   - This triggers the `[gcode_macro M600]` in your Klipper `printer.cfg` file, allowing you to control what happens next (e.g., pause, park, beep, wait for reload, etc.).
   - If the API call fails, LED blinks slowly 3 times as an error signal.

4. **On Filament Reload**
   - Device detects filament is loaded again.
   - If `auto_resume` is enabled, sends `/printer/print/resume` to Moonraker.
   - LED blinks twice to indicate reload.

5. **Web GUI**
   - Visit the device IP in a browser to:
     - Change Moonraker server address and API key
     - View live status (WiFi, Moonraker, filament, last action)
     - See LED status code chart

## Wiring

- **Sensor Pin:** Connect your filament runout switch (NO/NC) to D2 (NodeMCU/Wemos D1 Mini, GPIO4).
- **LED Pin:** Onboard LED is D4 (GPIO2, active LOW).

## Example Klipper Macro (`printer.cfg`)

```ini
[gcode_macro M600]
gcode:
  PAUSE
  G91
  G1 Z10 F1000
  G90
  # Add additional script for filament change, beep, move, etc.
```

## Installation & Flashing

1. Flash the firmware to your ESP8266/ESP32 (using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).
2. Connect the board to your printerâ€™s runout switch and power.
3. Connect to WiFi (SSID and password are set in the source code).
4. Visit the device's IP address in a browser to configure Moonraker API details.

## LED Status Table

| Status                         | LED Behavior         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Filament present                | Solid ON            |
| Runout (while printing)         | Rapid blinking      |
| No filament (idle)              | OFF, short blink    |
| Filament reloaded/ready         | ON, short blink     |
| Comms/API error                 | Slow even blinking  |

---

## Notes

- The device uses a simple debounce logic to avoid false triggers.
- EEPROM is used for persistent settings.
- All status and actions are visible in the Web GUI.
- For ESP32, use `WiFi.h` and `WebServer` (see comments in `.ino`).
